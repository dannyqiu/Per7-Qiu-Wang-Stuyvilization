Game Ideas/Rules:
- Each player starts with a Settler and a General on opposite sides of map:
- Settlers can (1) move (2) create city tile
- City tile engulfs surrounding tiles
- You gain resources from all tiles you own , move further , gain combat bonus while on friendly tiles.
- The city only gets resources from tiles connected to the city.
- Melee units can capture other tiles if they are adjacent to one of your tiles:
- neutral tiles (1 turn) , enemy tiles ( 2 turns), fortified tiles (3 turn), cities (5 turns)
- You can neutrilize any tiles (1 turn)
- City produce units with gold, you get +x gold per turn from tiles.
- Units can (1) move (2) attack (3) capture/neutrilize 
- Certain units need certain resources (ie. calavary needs horses, swordsman need iron, etc)
- Win condition- capture enemy capital
